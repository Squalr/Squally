Changes to engine:

- experimental namespace changed to cocos_experimental due to conflicts with std::experimental

- Added SpriterPlusPlus external dependency
	SpriterPlusPlus changes:
	- Changed filefactory.h to SPPfilefactory.h due to filename conflict in cocos (caused linker issues)
	- Changed objectfactory.h to SPPobjectfactory.h due to filename conflict in cocos (caused linker issues)
- Added files from https://github.com/jeremyjh/Spriter2dX directly into the engine

- Implemented recursive file listing (async as well) in CCFileUtils. Some method definitions changed.

- cereal added as an external dependency
- ValueMaps, CCFileUtils updated to support binary serialization of ValueMaps

- In CCCamera, the default far plane was increased to 65535.0f

- In CCFastTMXLayer.cpp, frustum culling was updated to account for the camera distance

- In CCFastTMXTiledMap.cpp, empty tile layers were not deserialized

- In CCNode, added IsPaused() to be able to determine if a node is paused

- In CCNode.cpp, removed call to pause() in onExit(). This caused crashes when the game was closing.

- Made scrollChildren public in UIScrollView.h. This function allows scrolling by specific amounts (ie mousewheel).

- Moved from Windows 8 sdk to Windows 10

- Updated CCValue float/double serialization to exclude trailing zeros and to limit precision to 2 decimal places (as does TMX)

- Updated CCValueMap to be an ordered map instead of an unordered map

- Updated TinyXML2 serialization to use 1 space for indentation. This was done to match the indentation of TMX files generated by Tiled

- Fix to CCTMXXMLParser.cpp to convert the CCValue type of object/layer properties to the associated type in the TMX file (previously all values were deserialized as strings).

- Fix to CCTMXXMLParser.cpp to deserialize x/y/width/height values as floats instead of ints

- Fix to CCTMXXMLParser.cpp to deserialize polygoin x/y points as floats instead of ints

- Update to CCNode::onEnter() to remove all existing events on the object

- Update to engine localization to support all Steam languages

- UIRichText, CCTextFieldTTF, and UITextField, CCLabel, CCLabelTextFormatter reverted to cocos 3.16, and some fixes applied to make the code editor work. Lots of things fixed here -- multi-line textfield support, arrow movement support, vertical line space fixes, others I do not remember.

- Fix to CCGLViewImpl-desktop to allow enter key to insert a newline
