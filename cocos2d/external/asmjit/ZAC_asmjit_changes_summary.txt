- in asmjit_build.h ASMJIT_API macro was replaced with a macro that does nothing. This used to define dllexport, but this library is statically linked, not a DLL.
- Class Label was renamed to AsmLabel to avoid conflict with Cocos2d-x Label class
- AsmTK repository was combined with this one. I could not get the linker to properly handle:
	- AsmTK => AsmJit
	- Squally => AsmTK
	- Squally => AsmJit
	
	So the easy solution was to make AsmJit and AsmTk all under AsmJit.
